#### SIMON SAYS WHACK A MOLE

Demo: https://aimeepham14.github.io/SimonSaysWhackaMole/

### What's Going On here?

Can you help Simon pop the mole back into the hole? the There are 4 moles in 4 different colored holes. After the player clicks start, one of the colored moles will pop up. The player will need to "whack the mole" that popped up. After each successful round, the game will add another mole to the series which will require the player to repeat the same sequence order.

### TechStack Being Used
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript (DOM)


### MVP
* Create the whack a mole setting background
* Creating a start and restart button 
* Render the hole to light up somehow
* Render a random series of the different moles sequence
* Render the ability for the player to click and copy the exact sequence during each round
* Everytime a round ends the round counter should increase by 1
* A message should pop up if the player loses
* The player should be able to restart


### Stretch Goals
* Set a countdown timer
* Create an animation so a mole actually pops up
* Set a "highest score" counter
* Creating a cool mouse cursor that looks like a hammer

### Any Potential Roadblocks
* The computer not accepting the player's sequence
* The computer not knowing if the player's sequence is correct
