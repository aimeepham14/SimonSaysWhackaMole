#### **SIMON SAYS WHACK A MOLE**

### What's Going On here?

Can you help Simon pop the mole back into the hole? the There are 4 moles in 4 different colored holes. After the player clicks start, one of the colored moles will pop up. The player will need to "whack the mole" that popped up. After each successful round, the game will add another mole to the series which will require the player to repeat the same sequence order.

### TechStack Being Used
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript (DOM)


### MVP
* Create the whack a mole setting background
* Render a start screen with the instructions and a start button
* Render the mole to "pop up" out of the hole/light up somehow
* Render a random series of the different moles sequence
* Render the ability for the player to click and copy the exact sequence during each round
* Everytime a round ends the round counter should increase by 1
* A message should pop up if the player loses
* The player should be able to restart



### Stretch Goals
* Set a countdown timer
* Set the interval for the mole color to pop up quicker every 10 additional sequences
* Set a "highest score" counter
* Creating a cool mouse cursor that looks like a hammer

### Any Potential Roadblocks
* The visual of the "moles popping up" may not look right
* The computer not accepting the player's sequence
